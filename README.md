# ctf_scripts
Scripts to help out during a CTF instead of using web-based solutions or having to script it out everytime


Now i'm thinking of just taking all of these micro-services and putting them into an automated script where it automatically detects the encoding and format of the input string and runs the proper function on it (uses b64_2_ascii for base64 input)
